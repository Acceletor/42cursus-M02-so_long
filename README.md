# so_long
A small 2D game created as part of the 42 School curriculum, using C and the MiniLibX graphics library.

## Project Description
so_long is a simple tile-based game where the player must navigate through a maze-like map, collect all items (C), and reach the exit (E) while avoiding walls (1).
This project focuses on event handling, image rendering, and simple game logic using the MiniLibX library.

The game validates input maps and provides a basic but functional game loop with user interaction through keyboard inputs.

## Goals
- Learn basic 2D game concepts: map reading, player movement, collectibles, and exits.
- Handle user input and real-time updates using event hooks.
- Manage resources: loading and destroying images, windows, and handling memory leaks.
